## Guidelines For TAP Specification Changes

TAP is a venerable and widely used format for reporting test results in
a variety of languages and platforms.

Interoperability between these platforms is a high priority.  Thus:

* No changes will be accepted UNLESS they are adopted by multiple
  implementations representing a major portion of the TAP userbase.
* No changes will be blocked IF they are adopted by multiple
  implementations representing a major portion of the TAP userbase.
* Specification should remove as much ambiguity as possible, while
  maintaining backwards compatibility with existing TAP providers and
  consumers to the greatest degree possible.

The goal of this specification is to describe the landscape accurately, and
provide guidance for new TAP implementations.  It is a dictionary.

A good idea is not enough of a reason to change the specification!  But it
can be a great place to start.

If you have a feature that you'd like to see, you may find some people here
who can provide guidance.  But the place to champion for features is in the
implementations themselves.  When it is in wide enough usage, we will write
it down here.
